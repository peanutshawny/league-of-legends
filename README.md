Includes data analysis from matches pulled from kaggle and pca clustering of all champions.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective

### Methods Used
* PCA
* t-SNE
* kmeans
* Image pre-processing

### Technologies/Languages
* Python & Jupyter Notebook
* Riot Games Developer API
* Cassiopeia (Python API wrapper for Riot API)

## Project Description
League of Legends is a team oriented video game where on two team teams (with 5 players in each) compete for objectives and kills. Being an avid League of Legends player for over 8 years, I thought it was about time that I took some data from the game and made an effort to take a deeper dive into some of the champions. 

I wanted to cluster champions by both their in-game stats and their appearance. This will hopefully yield some insights about how champions were designed and also some cool visualizations.

## Description of my Current Process
Check out my notebooks and scripts for more details! (work in progress)

## Conclusion & Next Steps
Good project all in all! I learned a lot about different dimensionality reduction techniques in addition to gaining some skills in image filter and working with apis. 

Next Steps:
* Perform PCA/t-SNE on champion splash art as that would theoretically provide more data to draw features from
* Look for matches and perform some exploratory analysis
* Further modularize code, including building different python files for visualization
