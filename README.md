## Project Description
League of Legends is a team oriented video game where on two team teams (with 5 players in each) compete for objectives and kills. Being an avid League of Legends player for over 8 years, I thought it was about time that I took some data from the game and made an effort to take a deeper dive. 

I wanted to first, cluster champions by both their in-game stats and their appearance. This will hopefully yield some insights about how champions were designed and also some cool visualizations. Secondly, I want to take a look at some ranked matches and do some exploratory analysis, hopefully coming out with some more information on tactics and strategies to be used in order to maximize my own win/loss ratio.
